            Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
            This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the remote ref is the expected value. "git push" fails otherwise.            
            Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published. 
            You will have to bypass the "must fast-forward" rule in order to replace the history you originally published with the rebased history.
            If somebody else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing, the tip of the branch at the remote may advance with her commit, and blindly pushing with --force will lose her work.
